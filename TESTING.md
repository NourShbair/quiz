## Code Validation
### Python

I have used the recommended [PEP8 CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all of my Python files.

## Browser Compatibility
I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.

| Browser | Home | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/chrome.png) | Works perfectly as expected |
| Firefox | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/firefox.png) | Works perfectly as expected |
| Safari | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/safari.png) | Could not read input from user |

## Lighthouse Audit

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues.

| Page | Mobile | Desktop | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/lighthouse-mobile.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/lighthouse-desktop.png) | Works as expected |

## Defensive Programming
Defensive programming was manually tested with the below user acceptance testing:

## Bugs

- `Invalid username` when trying to enter empty space, or a name doesn't contain any letters

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug-fixed-username.png)

    - To fix this, I validate the username to be non-empty, and containing at least one character.
        ```python
        def validate_username(name):

            for char in name:
                if char.isalpha():
                    return True
            return False
        ```

- `ValueError:` invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'answer'

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug-fixed-answer.png)

    - To fix this, I validate the answer to be exactly a number from 1 to 4.
        ```python
        def validate_answer(question, answer):
            """
            Inside the try, converts string value into int.
            Raises ValueError if strings cannot be converted into int,
            or if it is not one of 4 answers options (1,2,3,4).
            """
            possible_answers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
            ans = int(answer)
            if ans not in possible_answers:
                print("\n")
                colored_print(
                    "Invalid data: pleaser enter a number from 1,2,3 and 4:",
                    constants.YELLOW,
                    "center",
                )
                print("\n")
                ans = input(constants.CENTER_SPACE)
                return validate_answer(question, ans)
            else:
                entered_answer = question.answers[ans - 1]
                if entered_answer.is_correct():
                    print("\n")
                    colored_print(
                        "Great job! ðŸŽ‰ Thatâ€™s the correct answer! Keep it up!",
                        constants.GREEN,
                        "center",
                    )
                    return True
                else:
                    return False
        ```

- Python `E501 line too long` and `W291 trailing whitespace`

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug-fixed-long-lines.png)

    - To fix this, I added 'noqa' for the long line
        ```python
        WELCOME_MSG = """ # noqa
        ```
    

## Unfixed Bugs

- The app may fail to read user input when running on the Safari browser.
